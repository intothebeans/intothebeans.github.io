## About Me

My name is Aiden, and I am a recent college graduate eager to embark on the next chapter of my professional journey. I have a dual background in music and computer science, which may seem unconventional at first glance. However, computers and music have been historically intertwined. I selected music as a field of study to provide a challenging academic experience. During my secondary education, I was enrolled in a magnet program for information technology. I discovered that I have a natural aptitude for technology and prefer to learn related subjects at my own pace outside of a traditional classroom setting. Christopher Newport University offered a distinctive program in the music department that explored the overlap between music and technology. After discussing the program with the department head, I was convinced it was the right choice for me. It was challenging, particularly during the first two semesters. It was certainly a challenge to dictate melodies at eight in the morning! From practicing two hours a day to attending the required fifteen events per semester, there were times I considered abandoning the program entirely. Nevertheless, I persisted.

In my computer science courses, I found the challenges and projects to be engaging and rewarding. The coursework provided me with a strong foundation in key areas such as Git usage, test writing, data structures, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. I particularly enjoyed the final course, Data Communication Systems. It provided an in-depth examination of computer networking. I find the subject matter quite exciting. My initial exposure to the field of networking was setting up a home server out of curiosity and the urge to tinker. I also spent time viewing preparation videos for the Network+ certification purely out of interest. I recall staying back one day to ask the professor a question, and in return, he inquired about my major. When I responded, he noted that it made sense. I was doing very well in the course, and he observed a trend of Computer Science students performing poorly because they believe they know everything. I found that observation amusing. I don't believe it's possible to know everything about networking. I don't believe it's possible to know everything about any subject. There's always more to learn.

I am now embarking on a self-paced learning journey with the goal of expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity. I am eager to gain further expertise in this field and embark on a career in this area.
